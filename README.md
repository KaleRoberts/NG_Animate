# NG_Animate
Learning about some of the features of Angular's ngAnimate module

These files need to be served all together and so far I've been doing that with browser-sync

npm install -g browser-sync

And then you can server all of the files locally like this (port 3000 is just default, you can choose any port really):

browser-sync start --server --port 3000 --files"./*"
